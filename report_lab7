Using nginx as reverse-proxy with uWSGI as WSGI for my storage.

storage.conf is nginx configuration file that is
located in /etc/nginx/sites-available/
when enabled goes into /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

Created self-signed certificate with openssl command.
The resulting public key is stored under /etc/ssl/private.
The resulting certificate is stored under /etc/ssl/certs/

Generated dh group to use DHE-ciphers with command
'sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem 4096'

The following lines are part of storage.conf file

ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/ecc_key.pem;
ssl_protocols       TLSv1.3 TLSv1.2;
ssl_ciphers         TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384...;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem;

Supported TLS versions are 1.3 and 1.2 because they are the most "fresh" and secure among the others
and are recommended by owasp.
Ciphersuits string was copy pasted from owasp cheatsheet for TLS. I have chosen the most secure decision provided.

ADDITIONAL:
sudo openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out /etc/ssl/private/ecc_key.pem
sudo openssl req -new -sha256 -key /etc/ssl/private/ecc_key.pem -out /etc/ssl/private/csr.csr
New Private Key = /etc/ssl/private/ecc_key.pem

sudo openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 10 -key /etc/ssl/private/ecc_key.pem -in /etc/ssl/private/csr.csr -out /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.pem
New certificate = /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.pem
